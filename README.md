# Toolkit for Puppet module development

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/instruct-br/puppet-toolkit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/instruct-br/puppet-toolkit)

This is a simple toolkit that uses Vagrant to setup virtual machines for Puppet module development and is used by [Instruct](http://instruct.com.br) developers.

It is very opinionated and based on our workflow, although it should be very useful for many people.

## Quick start

1. Make sure VirtualBox and Vagrant are installed
2. Clone the project repository
3. Edit `environment.yaml` to your needs if needed
4. Run `vagrant up <VM>`

The virtual machine will have the puppet-agent package installed and ready to go.

## 10-min Puppet Server start

1. Make sure VirtualBox and Vagrant are installed
1. Clone the project repository
1. Edit `environment.yaml` to your needs if needed
1. Copy `scripts/puppet.sh.sample` to `scripts/puppet.sh` and edit it to config the controlrepo name and Puppet Server role
1. Run `vagrant up puppet`

The virtual machine will have the Puppet Server installed and configured, ready to configure the clients VMs.

## Configuration

All configuration is loaded from `environment.yaml` file. There are two main keys: `defaults` and `nodes`.

```yaml

defaults:
  memory: 1024
  cpus: 1
  domain: 'dev'

```

The `defaults` hash has keys that configure how VirtualBox and Vagrant will work and also values that configure the VMs specified in the `nodes` hash.

On the `nodes` hash there is the definition of the VMs that will be managed by Vagrant.

The `puppet` VM is the one that we use to setup Puppet Server and has more memory and CPUs than the other nodes, which will use the values from `defaults` if not specified.

## Boxes

We chose Vagrant boxes that are as close as possible to a vanilla and minimal installation of the corresponding operating system. Better yet if the box is built and maintained by the vendor itself.

This choice helps us greatly reduce the risk of developing code that might fail on other people's systems and also have less assumptions about what is or not installed.

## TODO

* Document our workflow
* Document `local.yaml` usage
* Instructions on how to configure text editor, tests, etc.
* Minimalistic Puppet module to configure Puppet Server
* Rake task for installing puppet agent on developers system
* Rake task for deploying tools (r10k, puppet-lint, rspec, etc)
* Rake task that deploy puppetserver into the Puppet vm
* Rake task to setup control-repo (links inside the puppet vm)
* Rake task that call vagrant (in case we replace vagrant with AWS or DO)
